# Nixtla Shared Libraries Information Repository

You've landed on the central information repository for Nixtla's shared libraries. This repository has been established as a hub for all the shared and common information across our different libraries. 

Our system is designed to ensure that any modifications made to the files within this repository will automatically trigger a Pull Request (PR) within each respective library to reflect the most recent changes. This keeps our libraries synchronized and up-to-date, reducing the risk of inconsistencies or outdated information.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

1. **docs/contribute**: This directory includes resources for anyone looking to contribute to the Nixtla universe, our 'nixtlaverse'. Here, you'll find guidelines on how to contribute, our required tech stack, a description of each issue label, and a visual step-by-step tutorial with images to guide your contribution journey.

2. **styles**: This directory contains information about the shared look and feel of our libraries' websites. Any change in the styles directory will reflect across all library websites, maintaining a consistent design and user experience.

## How It Works

We employ a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to track changes in this repository. Here's how it works:

1. When a change is made to any file in this repository, our CI/CD system detects it.
2. The system automatically generates a new Pull Request on each library repository.
3. This PR contains the changes made to the shared information.
4. The maintainers of each library are responsible for reviewing and merging the PRs.
