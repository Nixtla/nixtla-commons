# Intro

If you're interested in contributing to the Nixtla project, we're excited to have you on board! The project adheres to the Git Flow convention, so you'll need to follow certain steps to ensure your contributions are effectively integrated. Here's a brief introduction to get you started:

**0. Prerequisites:**

- *GitHub*: You should already have a GitHub account and a basic understanding of its functionalities. Alternatively check [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).
- *Python*: Python should be installed on your system. Alternatively check [this guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
- *conda*: You need to have conda installed, along with a good grasp of fundamental operations such as creating environments, and activating and deactivating them.  Alternatively check [this guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). 

**1. Fork the Project:** 
Start by forking the Nixtla repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the project where you can make changes without affecting the main repository.

**2. Clone the Forked Repository and Set Up a Conda Environment:**
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nixtla.git`. This allows you to work with the code directly on your system.

Next, you'll need to set up a Conda environment. First, ensure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system. Then, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda create -n nixtla-env python=3.10`. Activate your new environment with `conda activate nixtla-env`. (See concrete instructions below.)

**3. Create a Feature Branch:** 
Create a new branch for the feature you're working on using `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.

**4. Make Your Changes:** 
Make changes to the codebase, ensuring your changes are self-contained and cohesive.

**5. Commit Your Changes:** 
Add the changed files using `git add .`, then commit these changes using `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`.

**6. Push Your Changes:** 
Push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub with `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.

**7. Open a Pull Request:** 
Open a pull request from your new branch on the Nixtla repository on GitHub. Provide a thorough description of your changes when creating the pull request.

**8. Wait for Review:** 
The maintainers of the Nixtla project will review your changes. Be ready to iterate on your contributions based on their feedback.

Remember, contributing to open-source projects is a collaborative effort. Respect the work of others, welcome feedback, and always strive to improve. Happy coding!

## 1. Create a fork of the mlforecast repo.
The first thing you need to do is create a fork of the GitHub repository to your own account:
![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/af767f5b-66f1-4068-9dd2-917096285ae9)

Your fork on your account will look like this:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/912b848d-d3d1-4f79-9d5b-10dd66e1bd35)

In that repository, you can make your changes and then request to have them added to the main repo.

## 2. Clone the repository.

In this tutorial, we are using Mac (also compatible with other Linux distributions). If you are a collaborator of Nixtla, you can request an AWS instance to collaborate from there. If this is the case, please reach out to Max or Fede on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nixtlacommunity/shared_invite/zt-1pmhan9j5-F54XR20edHk0UtYAPcW4KQ) to receive the appropriate access. We also use Visual Studio Code, which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Once the repository is created, you need to clone it to your own computer. Simply copy the repository URL from GitHub as shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/1331354e-ac24-4222-82f1-71df7077f2e0)

Then open Visual Studio Code, click on "Clone Git Repository," and paste the line you just copied into the top part of the window, as shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/982827d5-89a6-43d4-8bb8-85bd1758bc10)

Select the folder where you want to copy the repository:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/c1a169e6-df27-41fb-84ee-a441a149e3d6)

And choose to open the cloned repository:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/00140c15-237e-4afa-a47d-078a1afbbac0)

You will end up with something like this:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/ea4aed6f-2000-4ec8-a242-36b9dfd68d26)


## 3. Create the Conda environment.

Open a terminal within Visual Studio Code, as shown in the image:

<img width="1423" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/9b3ed42f-1a68-450c-bffd-a7cee40bb781">

You can use conda but we highly recommend using Mamba to speed up the creation of the Conda environment. To install it, simply use `conda install mamba -c conda-forge` in the terminal you just opened:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/08482b00-9434-46f0-9452-c3f4920eca6d)

Create an empty environment named `mlforecast` with the following command: `mamba create -n mlforecast python=3.10`:
![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/5e9032e8-3f5b-4a1c-93e7-3d390d5f73f1)

Activate the newly created environment using `conda activate mlforecast`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/803ae2b7-8369-4a24-9b7c-9326d52c13ef)

Install the libraries within the environment file `environment.yml` using `mamba env update -f environment.yml`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/e9672d58-b477-4963-9751-277c944a4d8a)

Now install the library to make interactive changes and other additional dependencies using `pip install -e ".[dev]"`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/501c8223-862d-40a9-8f2d-ecdaceaeaedb)

## 4. Make the changes you want.

In this section, we assume that we want to increase the default number of windows used to create prediction intervals from 2 to 3. The first thing we need to do is create a specific branch for that change using `git checkout -b [new_branch]` like this:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/7884f89a-ecc6-4200-8176-6a9b9f7c0aa2)

Once created, open the notebook you want to modify. In this case, it's `nbs/utils.ipynb`, which contains the metadata for the prediction intervals. After opening it, click on the environment you want to use (top right) and select the `mlforecast` environment:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/0a0a8285-9344-471e-b699-8bc13159e3a8)

Next, execute the notebook and make the necessary changes. In this case, we want to modify the `PredictionIntervals` class:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/0a614d14-52c9-4ba1-88e5-02e19661cae7)

We will change the default value of `n_window` from 2 to 3:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/af31a79d-0165-4c79-94bc-f411ec67b3ea)

Once you have made the change and performed any necessary validations, it's time to convert the notebook to Python modules. To do this, simply use `nbdev_export` in the terminal.


You will see that the `mlforecast/utils.py` file has been modified (the changes from `nbs/utils.ipynb` are reflected in that module). Before committing the changes, we need to clean the notebooks using the command `./action_files/clean_nbs` and verify that the linters pass using `./action_files/lint`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/cecf76a1-c025-4b6f-97c0-584394a3f56a)

Once you have done the above, simply add the changes using `git add nbs/utils.ipynb mlforecast/utils.py`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/107689d8-a270-4621-ac5d-9d077d9203c3)

Create a descriptive commit message for the changes using `git commit -m "[description of changes]"`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/034578e2-d63c-4d74-a96f-99f405288326)

Finally, push your changes using `git push`:

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/49c6851c-949b-4ca7-ac38-6b17ec103437)


## 5. Create a pull request.

In GitHub, open your repository that contains your fork of the original repo. Once inside, you will see the changes you just pushed. Click on "Compare and pull request":

![image](https://github.com/Nixtla/how-to-contribute-nixtlaverse/assets/10517170/c3d2ce0d-5fc9-4356-87d3-51b32e72524a)

Include an appropriate title for your pull request and fill in the necessary information. Once you're done, click on "Create pull request".
